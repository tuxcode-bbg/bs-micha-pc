This directory contains scripts / config files, that are
intended to be installed onto the target filesystem.
Examples are:
* init scripts for daemons
* config files

Generally speaking, stuff that is not always needed on the
target rootfs.
Files from here are typically installed from the daemon's
make target.
Stuff that needs to be always there on the target rootfs
should go to skel-root/*
